                           Benefit of using HtmlAsString ðŸ˜Š ( Step toward to Microservice APP )

1.	We can develop static and dynamic control and put them into fast access environment Ex:
Akamai, Redis , Cassandra, hazelcast, Google Cloud Storage.

2.	HtmlAsString  Transmitted via Rest or Web api under secure environment .

3.	 HtmlAsString   get consumed in DOM or Real Dom so we can make open communication between parent to child and 
Child to parent .. Which is not possible in Iframe Culture.

4.	We Not Need any CMS Tool to develop HtmlAsString its can be done by Front-End Developer.

5.	Style and Layout of  component easily be maintain by Global CSS define and lossy couple.

6.	All componentâ€™s are developed independently and driven by Query String .. Meanâ€™s we can pass

Parameter Value so  to API to collect dynamic htmltostring information.

7.	Itâ€™s  Developer control to Make API call for htmltoString , Meanâ€™s no extra rendering 
(if we are working in React or Angular we are enjoying SPA completely )
